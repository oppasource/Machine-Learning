Linear Regression using Gradient Descent demonstrates the use of gradient descent algorithm to minimize the loss function from scratch. We we only use numpy for most of the work.

Regression using scikit-learn demonstrates how we can use scikit-learn library to implement regression. We also go through how we can perfrom polynomial regression in addition to linear regression.
